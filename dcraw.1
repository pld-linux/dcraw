.SH NAME
dcraw - convert raw digital photos to PPM format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dcraw 
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dcraw
converts a list of raw digital camera files to
.BR ppm (5)
format.  Dozens of cameras are supported, and new ones are
added as they reach the market.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -i
Identify files but don't decode them.
Exit status is 0 if
.B dcraw
can decode the last file, 1 if it can't.
.TP
.B -c
Write binary image data to standard output.
Otherwise,
.B dcraw
creates files with a ".ppm" extension.
.TP
.B -v
Print verbose messages.  Otherwise,
.B dcraw
prints only warnings and errors.
.TP
.B -f
Interpolate RGB as four colors.  The default is to assume that
all green pixels are the same.  If even-row green pixels are
more sensitive to ultraviolet light than odd-row green pixels,
this difference causes a mesh pattern in the output.
.B -f
solves this problem with minimal loss of detail.
.TP
.B -d
Show the raw data as a grayscale image with no interpolation.
Good for photographing black-and-white documents.
.TP
.B -q
Use simple bilinear interpolation for quick results.  The
default is to use a slow, high-quality adaptive algorithm.
.TP
.B -h
Half-size the output image.  Instead of interpolating, reduce
each 2x2 block of sensors to one pixel.  Much faster than
.BR -q .
.TP
.B -g gamma
Specify the gamma value for eight-bit output.  Default is 0.6.
.TP
.B -b brightness
Specify the output brightness.  Default is 1.0.
.TP
.B -a
Automatic color balance.  The default is to use a fixed
color balance based on a white card photographed in sunlight.
.TP
.B -w
Use the color balance specified by the camera.
If this can't be found,
.B dcraw
prints a warning and reverts to the default.
.TP
.B -r red_mul -l blue_mul
After all other color adjustments, multiply the red and blue
channels by these values.  Default is 1.0.
.TP
.B -2
Write eight bits per color value with gamma correction and
automatic brightness adjustment.  Double the height
if necessary to correct the aspect ratio.  This is the default.
.TP
.B -4
Write sixteen bits per color value, with no gamma correction,
no brightness adjustment, and no changes to the aspect ratio.
.TP
.B -3
Same image as
.BR -4 ,
written in Adobe PhotoShop format.  File extension is ".psd".
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ppm(5), ppm2tiff(1), pnmtotiff(1), pnmtopng(1), gphoto2(1).
.SH BUGS
The
.B -w
option does not work with many cameras.
.P
No attempt is made to save camera settings or thumbnail images.
.P
Author stubbornly refuses to add more output formats.
.P
Don't expect
.B dcraw
to produce the same images as software provided by the camera
vendor.  Sometimes
.B dcraw
gives better results!
.SH TIPS
First raise the brightness if the highlights are too dark,
then lower the gamma if the lowlights are too dark.
Use
.B -q
or
.B -h
until you get it right.
.P
To balance the color, do
.RB \^" dcraw\ -q\ -g\ 1\ -b\ 0.5 \^"
and select a rectangle of something that you know is white.
Compute the average R, G, and B values for this area, then
set red_mul and blue_mul to G/R and G/B.
